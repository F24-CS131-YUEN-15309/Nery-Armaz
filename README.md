This video presentation will be for CS 131 or Discrete Structures and it will cover Quantum Computers. In this presentation I will be covering topics like what is the quantum computer, how it works, its history, how the quantum computer is being utilized today, and the future of the quantum computer. The video will also cover qubits which is a key aspect of how the computer completes its computations, and it will cover other quantum mechanic properties like quantum entanglement and superposition. Other topics like decoherence / "noise" will be discussed along with methods that researchers are using to prevent these issues for the quantum computer. In this presentation, we will understand that quantum computers have already shown lots of potential for what they can right now and for the future, but as of currently they still aren't as reliable as modern computers.
